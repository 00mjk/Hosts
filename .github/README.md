## *Notice: I don't plan any time soon to abandon the list but it might only get one update or less a week as the list is getting big and very hard for me to maintain by myself (hard to keep stable & school) so any and all help is appreciated*

## *I am also working to rewrite the main host file to make it smaller while more effective; there will be little, or no updates until that is done*

## Main Lists

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

* [`Filters Adaptation`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Filters%20Adaptation) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers formatted to fit a filter list syntax.

* [`Experimental Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Experimental%20Hosts) - Experimental hosts - testing breakage before putting into hosts/lists

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - This is a collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies/domains.

* [`Other Formats`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Other%20Formats) - This is a folder for extra blocklist formats. Specifically made to help block things on archive.org as the normal way of blocking with 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, and || wont get the trackers due to the weird way they use the archived sites URLs.
