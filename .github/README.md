## Main Lists

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - Collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies or hide specific things.

* [`/Extensions/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Extensions) - Compliments to the main hosts file.

* [`/Whitelist Services/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Whitelist%20Services) - Collection of lists that help you to whitelist a broken service--service specific because it will whitelist ads/trackers.

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blacklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

### My hosts are now in filter list format; I will not change the name of the repository or file because it would cause problems with people who are already using the list.
