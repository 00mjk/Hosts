## The rewrite of my main hosts file is finished! It's now in filter list format; I will not change the name of the repository or file because it would cause problems with people who are already using the list.

## Main Lists

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

* [`Experimental Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Experimental%20Hosts) - Experimental hosts - testing breakage before putting into hosts/lists

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - This is a collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies/domains.

* [`Other Formats`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Other%20Formats) - This is a folder for extra blocklist formats. Specifically made to help block things on archive.org as the normal way of blocking with 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, and || wont get the trackers due to the weird way they use the archived sites URLs.
