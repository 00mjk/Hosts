## The rewrite of my main hosts file is finished! It's now in filter list format; I will not change the name of the repository or file because it would cause problems with people who are already using the list.

## Main Lists

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - This is a collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies/domains.

## Contribution
To contribute to any of the blocklists create a new [`Issue`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/issues/new/choose) and choose from an existing template or create a new one
