## Main Lists

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - This is a collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies.

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blacklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

* [`Hardened Hosts`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/blob/master/Hosts%20(Hardened)) - A hardened version of my main hosts file that greatly improves privacy with as little downsides as possible.

## Contribution
To contribute to any of the blocklists create a new [`Issue`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/issues/new/choose) and choose from an existing template or create a new one

<hr>

### My hosts are now in filter list format; I will not change the name of the repository or file because it would cause problems with people who are already using the list.
