## Main Lists

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

* [`Experimental Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Experimental%20Hosts) - Experimental hosts - testing breakage before putting into hosts/lists

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - This is a collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies/domains.
