Expermiental.txt - Hosts file to only be used by me. Used to test blocking links that may or may not be trackers

Hosts.txt - The main hosts file for ad blocking with a combination of ScriptBlock.txt and Malware.txt

Malware.txt - Blocks malware URLs

ScriptBlock.txt - Blocks scripts for analytic services, fingerprinting services, popups that tell you to turn your adblocker off as well as some ad services

Anti Google.txt - Blocks everything I could find on Google, best used on Android to help keep Google from tracking everything you do

Anti Yahoo.txt - Great for blocking crap from Yahoo if you don't use Yahoo's Search Engine or Flickr

Anti Facebook.txt - Blocks things from Facebook (https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9941-how_facebook_tracks_you_on_android and https://privacyinternational.org/types-abuse/facebook)
