# Cybo's Hosts
A blocklist of ads, trackers, anti-adblock, malware, IP grabbers, and tracking cookies

<br>

## Lists

* [`Hosts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Hosts) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers.

* [`Filters Adaptation`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/master/Filters%20Adaptation) - The main blocklist for trackers, ads, malware, and IP grabbers formatted to fit a filter list syntax.

* [`Dark Mode`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/blob/master/Dark%20Mode/Dark%20Mode) - This is a userstyle for uBlock Origin that will make supported pages pitch black instead of white or grey. Great for OLED screens.

* [`/Anti/`](https://github.com/Cybo1927/Hosts/tree/master/Anti) - This is a collection of lists to block all servers from the specified apps/companies/domains.
